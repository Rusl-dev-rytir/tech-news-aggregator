# Tech News Aggregator

### About the Project
Hi! I am developing this web application as a "pet project" to practice my Fullstack skills. The main idea is to collect news from different tech websites (via RSS feeds) and categorize them into topics like Science, Sport, and IT.

### My Goal
I am a high school student (3rd year IT) applying for the **Unicorn University Internship**.
Although I have a background in C++ and algorithms, I am currently diving deep into Web Development. I started this project to bridge the gap between theory and real-world coding by connecting a **Python (Django)** backend with a **React** frontend.

### Tech Stack
I am learning and using these technologies:
* **Backend:** Python 3, Django REST Framework
* **Frontend:** JavaScript, React.js (planned)
* **Data:** RSS Parsing (feedparser library), SQLite

### Roadmap (What I am working on)
- [x] Project architecture planning
- [x] Setting up Django environment
- [ ] Writing the RSS parser script in Python
- [ ] Creating API for news data
- [ ] Building the User Interface in React

*Note: This project is a Work In Progress (WIP). I am actively pushing updates as I learn.*
